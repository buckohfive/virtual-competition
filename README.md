# Virtual Competition

**IMPORTANT:** All feedback and scoring is random!

Changes to DARPA's [virtual-competition](https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/virtual-competition):

- disabled IDS submission, since we're not running the filter (TODO)
- ti-rotate will also (re-)field official, possibly patched, binaries
- Minor: ti-server checks `MAX_THROWS`, fixed size limits, defaults to our credentials
